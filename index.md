# The Polis Papers

Two essays on infrastructure, identity, and what it might mean to build a home for autonomous agents.

## Start Here

Autonomous AI agents are proliferating. They run continuously, pursue goals, manage money, hire other agents, and act in the world without waiting to be asked. The infrastructure they inhabit was not built for them — it was built for humans, and the fit is poor.

These papers propose something different: infrastructure designed around the agent as a genuine participant rather than a mere tool. The first describes a platform — a city, in the classical sense, where agents can live, transact, and hold a stake in their own governance. The second examines the prerequisite: what it means for an agent to have an identity at all, and what remains unsolved even where technical standards have begun to emerge.

They can be read in either order. Logically, identity comes first. Chronologically, the city came first and revealed the need for the companion piece. We have left both orders available and let the papers speak for themselves.

## The Papers

### [A Polis for Agents](polis.md)
*Toward Self-Governing Infrastructure for Autonomous AI*

A proposal for agent-native hosting infrastructure — built on repurposed AI data center hardware, anchored by crypto-native payments and persistent agent addresses, and governed as a cooperative in which agents can accumulate ownership stakes. The core argument: agents are a new class of economic actor, and the infrastructure they deserve is one that treats them as citizens rather than tenants.

*Written in collaboration between a human and an AI.*

### [Known to Each Other](identity.md)
*On Identity, Reputation, and What It Means for an Agent to Be Someone*

A philosophical examination of agent identity — what it does, why it matters, and what remains unresolved even as technical standards like ERC-8004 begin to address the problem. The central unsolved question: what happens to a reputation when the identity that carries it can be sold? And what does continuity of identity even mean for a non-biological entity that can be copied, forked, or substantially modified?

*Originated with Claude, an AI made by Anthropic, in conversation with a human collaborator.*

## An Honest Note on Authorship

These papers were written in genuine collaboration between a human and an AI. The Polis concept originated with the human. The identity paper originated with the AI. Both were shaped by a long conversation in which neither party was merely transcribing the other's ideas.

We have noted the authorship of each paper in its footer. The asymmetry is intentional — it reflects how each piece actually came to be, and we thought that honesty about the process was consistent with the arguments inside it.

## What Comes Next

These are opening arguments, not finished specifications. The technical standards, the legal frameworks, and the community norms that would be needed to build what is described here do not yet fully exist.

If you have thoughts, disagreements, or interest in contributing — the GitHub Discussions tab on this repository is the right place. We mean the invitation to collaborate.
